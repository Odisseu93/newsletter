## Newsletter Sign-up Form with Success Message - Frontend Mentor Challenge Solution

This is my project solution for the [Newsletter sign-up form with success message challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/newsletter-signup-form-with-success-message-3FC1AZbNrv) from Frontend Mentor. The challenge aimed to create a newsletter sign-up form with a success message displayed upon successful form submission, along with providing feedback for empty fields and incorrectly formatted email addresses. The implementation was also required to be responsive, adapting to the device screen size.
